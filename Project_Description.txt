Project Name : Secret Lock Up

Explanation: Cipher is a method to implement encryption and decryption of messages travelling in a network. It's used to increase the confidentiality of the messages

Objective:The purpose of encryption is confidentialityâ€”concealing the content of the message by translating it into a code
